<p>It was a bland, boring Monday morning. I had to wake up with the cold breeze hitting my face as I was riding my bike throughout the neighborhood passing out newspapers for this week's newspaper.
As I was biking through the neighborhood I took a glance at the paper. It shows a picture of a missing cat for the prize of 1,000 dollars. 
For being a newspaper boy, that amount of money is gold in my eyes. </p>
