<a href="index.html">back to the start</a>

<p>I find myself running past familiar trees again and realize that Iâ€™m running back towards the original spot where the bowl of milk was placed. I accidentally corner myself from the creature and cover my face as the creature crawls up to me. After moments of silence I hear licking. I slowly opened my eyes to see that it was a small black cat licking the bowl of milk. 

It was the cat from the newspaper.
