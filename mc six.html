<h1>Bread</h1>

<p>While thinking about what I wanted to buy with my money, I heard a faint growl near me. I look up with my heart racing incredibly fast. I notice two red dots right ahead of me near one of the pieces of bread I dropped on the floor. 
My hearing begins to only focus on my heart beats and I start to breathe harder as the seconds go by. I slowly back away from the red eyes and my back meets the wall of the dead end.
