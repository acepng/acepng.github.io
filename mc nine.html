<h1>End</h1>

<a href="mc eight.html">go back</a>

<p>Tears of anxiety fill up my eyes and mess up my vision as I run away from the unknown creature that was following me. My surroundings are filled with trees and the night sky, no exit to be found anywhere. 

“This is the end.” I think to myself. This is it.
