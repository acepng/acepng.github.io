<p>After sending out all of the newspapers throughout the neighborhood I decided to keep one to myself and to look around for the cat as well. 
While biking through downtown I noticed there was a bakery nearby. I decided to get some bread for the cat. Cats like bread.. Right?
On the way out of the bakery I notice thereâ€™s a grocery store by the corner as well. So I ran by the grocery store to pick up milk for the cat as well.
